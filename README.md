<ol>

 <li>a) Show that the volume enclosed when revolving the curve <em>y </em>= <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) – where <em>f </em>: [<em>a,b</em>] → [0<em>,</em>∞) – about the <em>x</em>-axis in three-dimensional <em>x</em>–<em>y</em>–<em>z </em>space is given by</li>

</ol>

<em>Hint: </em>Think about the cross-sectional areas and the perfect symmetry when revolving the function around the x-axis.

<ol>

 <li>Hook’s law states that the force exerted by an ideal spring when extended from its equi-</li>

</ol>

librium position at <em>x </em>= 0 to length <em>x </em>is given by

<em>F</em>(<em>x</em>) = −<em>k x,</em>

where <em>k </em>is a positive constant characterizing the stiffness of the spring. Compute the work required to expand the spring from its equilibrium position to length <em>`</em>.

<ol>

 <li>Show that</li>

</ol>

is convergent.

<em>Hint: </em>There is no elementary way to evaluate this integral. However, to only <em>test </em>convergence, you can bound the integrand by a simpler function and use the following fact without proof: Let <em>f </em>: [<em>a,</em>∞) →R be a bounded and increasing function. Then lim<em><sub>x</sub></em><sub>→∞ </sub><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) exists. (The whole integral corresponds to the function <em>f </em>here.)
